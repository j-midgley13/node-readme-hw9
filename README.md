# ReadMe Generator Week 9  

## Introduction. 

This assignment was given to create a professional-looking README file through the use of node and the command line. We used js files and node to prompt questions to fill out a brand new readme file that can be used multiple times.

## Objectives. 

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of your project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added hear the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```

## Process 

* I first copied the homework into my own repository for the assignment.  
* I then installed inquirer into my repo.  
* I then went and formed basic questions in my index.js file for the ReadMe.  
* I then filled out the basics needed to link the inputs of the node questions to the generateMarkdown.js file. This made the ReadMe file.  
* I then continued to simplify code, and make the display of both the ReadMe and the index.js more palatable.  
* I added a function to prompt user to leave no empty fields.  

## Challenges

I had a hard time to start this project. Unlike the previous work (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), it was hard not to make a change and be able to see it immediately on a web browser live server.  
I had to be more within my own head to see the what needed to be on the screen in the future. I needed to plan steps ahead, which was different for me.  
I Also had troubles finding ways to get a picture of the license, but some classmates helped immensely with that.

## Summary

I learned a lot from this homework. I learned how to create a package.json file from npm i.  I learned how to install different packages into the json file and how to use them. I learned how to call different scripts in order to do certain functions. I learned how to write those files into different ones.
